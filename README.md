# BlackJack Game In Python
<p>Blackjack, also known as "21," is a classic card game where players aim to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each card has a point value: numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the hand.

### How to Play:
1. **Initial Deal**: The dealer gives two cards to each player and themselves. The dealer's second card is face-down.
2. **Player Turn**: Players decide whether to:
   - **Hit** (take another card) to get closer to 21.
   - **Stand** (keep their current hand) to lock in their total.
3. **Dealer Turn**: After all players finish, the dealer reveals their hidden card and must hit until they reach at least 17.
4. **Win or Lose**: The closest to 21 wins. Going over 21 is a bust (loss), and if the dealer busts, remaining players win.

The game combines skill and chance, with strategies to decide when to hit or stand based on the dealer's visible card.
